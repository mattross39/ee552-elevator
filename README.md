# Java Elevator Simulator Project:

### Project Description: 
Though we may take it for granted when using one, most modern elevators are powered by software control systems. In the simplest case of a one-elevator system, the elevator controller needs to remember which floors have been requested by elevator passengers and stop and open its doors when it arrives at the requested floor. From outside, if someone calls the elevator from the hallway, the control system needs to decide when the elevator should stop on that floor - does it finish transporting all the passengers or make an additional stop in the middle. In a multiple-elevator bank, if more than one elevator is currently in-use, the control system has to choose which elevator should respond to the call buttons.

### Minimal Requirements:
Simulate a multiple-elevator system consisting of:
One internal control panel for each elevator
Up/Down call buttons for each floor
Include an indicator of which floor each elevator is currently on and what direction it is moving if applicable
The elevators should take some amount of time to travel to each floor
Interactions with the control panel and call buttons cause the elevators to move
Interacting with the call buttons decides which elevator to dispatch

### Additional Features:
- Animation of the elevator movement
- Implement each control panel as a client-server interaction

# Project Plan:
### Key components of your system:
- Internal Control Panel 
- External Up/Down Buttons
- Elevator Position Display

### Key milestones you can target for each of the weeks:
1. Building basic interface
2. Making movement logic work 
3. Displaying movement 
4. Extra features 
  - Processing integration 
  - Client/Server Interaction

### How you will divide up work amongst the team members:
- John Gazzara - Team Leader
- Work on programming together during meeting times 
- Repository Sharing
- Can’t assign individual parts to members, we will all work simultaneously

### Assumptions you are making about the project:
- No mechanical failure
- Will function as intended to in real life
- Pressed buttons will depress 
- Doors not necessary

### Any requirements from the project description that are unclear or that you are not sure how to approach:
- Client/Server Interaction
- Breaking up the work by person is not optimal
